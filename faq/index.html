<p>Yes. I am committed to providing a safe, inclusive, and affirming space for individuals of all sexual orientations, gender identities, races, cultures, and backgrounds. I approach therapy with cultural humility and a deep respect for each client’s unique experiences and identities. My practice is grounded in ongoing education, reflection, and advocacy for equity and belonging.</p>
